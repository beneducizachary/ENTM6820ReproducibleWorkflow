# ENTM6820: Reproducible Workflow

## Best Management Practices for Wildflower Plantings

This project is an example analysis of data collected as part of the Best Management Practices for Wildflower Plantings research project at the Auburn University Bee Lab. The overarching goal of the project is to assess how well several fall management treatments (mowing, lightly-disking, and their combination) impact the trajectory of supplemental wildflower plantings for pollintators. Specifically, we are interested in the ability of each treatment to promote high wildflower density and diversity, as well as how the composition of wildflowers differs between treatments.
